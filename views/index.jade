        p(style='text-align: justify;')
          | Canada has been a special place for Brendan's family for a long time,
          | and a wedding seemed like the perfect opportunity to introduce one family to the other familyâ€™s traditions.

        p(style='text-align: justify;')
          | Brendan's grandmother, Ginger "Gigi" Heussler, spent her childhood in the house where she and her husband,
          | Bud "Boppa" Heussler, now spend their summers.
          | Brendan's father also spent his summers in this house, which played a large role in him meeting his wife,
          | who was across the lake in New York. Keeping with tradition, Brendan and his brother spent time during their summers up "at the lake."
          | Finally, Brendan brought Kaitlin to the house after they had been dating for 4.5 years.

        p(style='text-align: justify;')
          | After getting engaged, Brendan and Kaitlin sought a meaningful place to exchange their vows.
          | and decided that the Canada house was such a special place to Brendan -- and now Kaitlin --
          | that they would invite both families to come together and enjoy everything that it has to offer.

        p(style='text-align: justify;')
          | After deciding on the location and picking a reception venue, they also found out that the chapel nearby
          | (where the ceremony will be held) is the same chapel where Brendan, his brother, and his father were all baptized.
          | Brendan's grandparents still attend this chapel every Sunday during their summers there, and his grandfather sings in the chorus.
          | This was the perfect last piece to the puzzle: Brendan and Kaitlin knew that this was where they should be married.
